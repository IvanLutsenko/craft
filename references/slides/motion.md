# Motion and numbers

## Motion

The deck sets motion with one policy, `<html data-motion>`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `show` (set by `scaffold.py`) | Authored animations always play, for the talk |
| `auto` | Follows the viewer's reduced-motion setting |
| `static` | Final frames without motion, for reading and export |

`?motion=`, the `M` key and the panel button switch the mode. The choice is not saved. `deck.js` sets `:root[data-motion-state="on|off"]`. When `off` and in print, `base.css` finishes animations instantly. Do not write your own `prefers-reduced-motion` in deck CSS.

Motion belongs to the forward step: `[data-reveal] .block { animation }` sets only the start frame with `from`. The base state is the final frame, so static mode, print and going back show the content, not an empty start. An animation does not change pages. Mark an element that must leave after entering with `data-exit="intended"`.

## Authored motion

Shared components keep their own curves. These rules are for motion a deck adds in its own CSS to decor and drawn parts: a line, a path, a shape, a diagram mark. Text and content blocks never move: nothing fades, wipes or slides in, a reveal step simply shows its part.

- Pick the curve by the job. A move from one place to another: `cubic-bezier(.45, 0, .1, 1)`, a clear start and a soft landing. A line or shape drawn from nothing: `cubic-bezier(.25, .8, .25, 1)` over 0.8 to 1 s. One curve for everything flattens the hierarchy.
- Drawn parts of one step follow reading order, 40 to 80 ms apart; marks across a grid 80 to 120 ms apart. Text in the same step appears at once, without delay.
- A thing that grows as it travels takes the long settle, 600 ms or more. A quick ease-in-out lurches.
- A color change between distant hues takes about 200 ms. Slower, it passes through mud.
- Holding a result means stop. The final frame has no pulse and no second count.

## Numbers

Keep the final value in text. `data-count` counts up from zero only on a forward reveal:

```html
<div class="frag"><p class="type-metric" data-count data-count-duration="1200">12,400</p></div>
```

Separate thousands with a comma from five digits on. A plain space fails. The mechanics keep the number on one line and reserve the width of the final value. A note that explains the numbers waits for them: `<p class="type-note frag" data-frag="after-count">` joins the counters' click and shows when the longest one stops. Count values only, not step numbers or scale ticks. In a table, mark the number inside the cell: `<td class="num"><span data-count>1,240</span></td>`.
